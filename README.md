# Exploring k-nearest neighbors
In this repository, I play around with the k- nearest neighbour classifier as a learning exercise for my machine learning class.

Questions to be answered:
1. Which distance metric and why that?
2. Difference between the evaluation metrics - Recall, precision, F1 and accuracy
3. How to form a vector representation from a categorical data?
4. Explore knn for both regression and classification.

We have two notebooks exploring both regression and classification datasets.
